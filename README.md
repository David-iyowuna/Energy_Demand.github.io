1. The goal of this research is to develop a machine learning model to predict/forecast the Energy Demand in France over the next 12 months.

2. This project focuses on regression methods and time series forecasting for supervised and unsupervised learning strategies.

3. The dataset can also be used to investigate the relationship between weather and energy demand.

Remarks:
The most common applications of supervised machine learning are regression and classification.
To comprehend association and grouping, unsupervised machine learning is applied.

The electricity demand of France is very much dependent on weather data. 

The demand of France is an important driver of European electricity prices, as it is one of the biggest countries. 

France has a lot of interconnections with surrounding countries. 

Hence, in periods of high demand France is likely to import electricity from neighboring countries, which will result in higher prices in France and the other countries.

In periods of low demand, France is likely to export, which will result in lower prices.

That is the reason that market parties need a good insight and forecast of this demand in France.
